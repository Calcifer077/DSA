Tree is a hierarchial tree data structure in whih data is stored in levels.

It is derived from a real life tree.
As in a real life tree the most basic part is roots(or the first part) from which various branches are made towads the top.
The last part that exists in this hierarchy is the leafs.

The same is applied in the 'Tree' used in a computer just in opposite order.
The root is at the top whereas the leaves are are at the bottom.

            1//This is the root.
           /  \->Branches
          2    3//These are the children of the root(1).
        / | \
       4  5  6//These are the children of 2 and are called leaves as they are the last nodes in the structure.
