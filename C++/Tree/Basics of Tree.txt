Tree is a hierarchial tree data structure in whih data is stored in levels.

It is derived from a real life tree.
As in a real life tree the most basic part is roots(or the first part) from which various branches are made towads the top.
The last part that exists in this hierarchy is the leafs.

The same is applied in the 'Tree' used in a computer just in opposite order.
The root is at the top whereas the leaves are are at the bottom.

            1//This is the root.
           /  \->Branches
          2    3//These are the children of the root(1).
        / | \
       4  5  6//These are the children of 2 and are called leaves as they are the last nodes in the structure.



B tree -> are extended binary tree that are specialized in m-way searching. Order of this tree is defined as the maximum number of childen a node can accomodate.Therefore, the height of a b tree is relatively smaller than the height of AVL tree.

Properties of a B tree:
1. All leafs should be at the same level.
2. Every node in a B Tree will hold a maximum of m children and (m-1) keys.
3. Every node in a B tree, except root and leaf, can hold at least m/2 children.
4. The root node must have no less than two children.
5. A B tree always maintains sorted data..
