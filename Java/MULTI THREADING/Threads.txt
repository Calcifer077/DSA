Threads:
A thread is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing. 
It is a seperate path of execution.

Threads are independent. If there occurs exception in one thread, it doesn't affect other threads. It uses a shared memomry area.

Life cycle of a thread:->

Create ----t.start-----> Runnable ----JVM  Allocate processor ----> Running ----> Dead
                            ^
                            |
                        Non- Runnable

There are two ways to create a thread:
1. By extending thread class.
2. By using runnable interface.
